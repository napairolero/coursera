## Application Motivation
Have you ever wondered how MPG today compares to way back in 1974?

1. If you answered yes, continue on.
2. If no, you may kindly exit.

---  

## Application Structure
The shiny app

1. Guides the user to motor trend to pick any 2015 model
2. Requests three fields; cylinder, horsepower and weight. All data available on motor trend.
4. Trains linear regression on the mtcars data set from 1974.
5. Predicts mpg for the inputed data.
6. Asks the user to compare this to the actual mpg from motor trend.

## Model Details
The shiny app runs the following code to obtain the predicted 1974 mpg

```{r}
cylVal <- 4; hpVal <- 400; wtVal <- 2 #these values supplied by user
data(mtcars)
data <- mtcars
data$cyl <- factor(data$cyl)
reg <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl + hp, data = data)
newData <- data.frame("cyl" = factor(cylVal), "hp" = hpVal, "wt" = wtVal)
predict(reg, newData)
```
